## üöÄ Project Overview

This platform serves as a decentralized hub for Web3 professionals and recruiters. It addresses common issues in the tech hiring space by integrating AI for smarter matching and blockchain for verified, low-cost transactions. Users can create detailed profiles, post jobs, and find opportunities, while leveraging AI to understand skill gaps and job suitability. The Web3 integration ensures a transparent and secure payment system for platform fees.

## ‚ú® Key Features

### Core Functionality

- **User Authentication**: Secure JWT-based registration, login, and session management.
- **Profile Management**: Users can create and edit detailed profiles including their bio, skills, and LinkedIn URL.
- **Job Posting System**: Authenticated users can post new job opportunities with detailed descriptions, required skills, and budget.
- **Dynamic Job Feed**: A responsive, two-column grid layout to browse all available job listings.
- **Skill-Based Filtering**: A real-time search filter to find jobs based on specific skills.

### ü§ñ AI-Powered Features

- **PDF Resume Parsing**: Users can upload their resume in PDF format, and the backend AI will automatically parse it to extract and suggest relevant skills.
- **Job-Applicant Match Score**: Logged-in users can see a percentage-based "match score" on any job listing, showing them how well their skills align with the job's requirements.
- **Skill Extraction from Text**: Users can also paste their bio, and the AI will identify and suggest skills from the text.

### ‚õìÔ∏è Web3 Blockchain Integration

- **Decentralized Payments**: Before posting a job, users must pay a small platform fee using POL tokens on the Polygon Amoy testnet.
- **MetaMask Integration**: The application seamlessly connects with the user's MetaMask wallet to initiate and sign transactions.
- **On-Chain Verification**: The job posting form is only enabled after the payment transaction is successfully confirmed on the blockchain.

## üåê Application Workflow

1.  **Registration & Profile Setup**: A new user registers for an account. They navigate to their profile page and click "Edit."
2.  **AI Skill Extraction**: The user uploads their PDF resume. The AI backend parses the file, extracts skills, and auto-populates the skills field. The user saves their profile.
3.  **Job Posting**: A recruiter (or any user) decides to post a job. They fill out the job details form.
4.  **Web3 Payment**: To submit the job, the user is prompted to pay a small fee. They connect their MetaMask wallet (on the Polygon Amoy network) and approve the transaction.
5.  **Job Feed & Matching**: Once the transaction is confirmed, the job is posted. Other logged-in users can now see this job in the feed and click "See Your Match Score" to understand how their skills compare to the job requirements.
6.  **Filtering**: Users can type "React" or "Python" into the search bar on the job feed to instantly filter the list for relevant opportunities.
